### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Source location flagging chosen as core feature (most actionable intel)

- Skip live UEX pricing for v1
- Valakkar locations include Daymar (Stanton), not just Pyro
- Quasi Grazer native to Terra III, not microTech
- 9 low-confidence items flagged for gameplay validation before treating as reliable
