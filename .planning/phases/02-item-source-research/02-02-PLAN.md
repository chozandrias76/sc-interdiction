<objective>
Research and document source locations for mining/material Wikelo items.

Purpose: Compile where mining materials (Carinite, Quantanium, Jaclium, Saldynium) and SCU commodities can be obtained. Mining ships leaving these locations are carrying known valuable cargo.

Output: `.planning/phases/02-item-source-research/02-02-RESEARCH.md` with structured item→source mappings.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Research Carinite sources</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/02-item-source-research/02-02-RESEARCH.md</files>
  <action>
Use WebFetch to research Carinite on starcitizen.tools:
- Search for "Carinite" page
- Find which asteroids/planets have Carinite deposits
- Note which systems (Pyro-specific if applicable)
- Document refinery locations where it can be processed

Create research file:

# Phase 2 Plan 02: Mining/Material Items Research

## Carinite
- **Mining Locations:** [asteroid fields, planet surfaces]
- **Systems:** [Pyro, Stanton, etc.]
- **Method:** Mining (ROC, Prospector, MOLE)
- **Refinery Processing:** [where to refine]
- **Reliability:** [1-5]
- **Notes:** [best locations, yield info]

Use WebFetch to research Quantanium on starcitizen.tools:
- Search for "Quantanium" page
- Find asteroid fields with Quantanium rocks
- Document volatility/handling requirements
- Note best mining locations per system

Add to research file:
```markdown
## Quantanium
- **Mining Locations:** [specific asteroid fields]
- **Systems:** [Aaron Halo, Yela, etc.]
- **Method:** Mining (ship mining, volatile)
- **Refinery Processing:** [time-sensitive due to volatility]
- **Reliability:** [1-5]

  <action>
Use WebFetch to research Jaclium and Saldynium on starcitizen.tools:
- Search for each ore page
- Find mining locations
- Document any Pyro-specific ores
- Note rarity and value

Add to research file:

  <files>.planning/phases/02-item-source-research/02-02-RESEARCH.md</files>
  <action>
Research any SCU-based commodities that Wikelo accepts:
- Check if any refined ores or trade goods are Wikelo inputs
- Document commodity terminals where they're sold

Create summary table of all mining/material items:
```markdown
## Other Materials/Commodities

[If any SCU goods are Wikelo inputs, document here]

## Summary: Mining Item Sources

| Item | Primary Location | System | Method | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Carinite | [location] | Pyro | Mining | [notes] |
| Quantanium | Aaron Halo | Stanton | Mining | Volatile |
| Jaclium | [location] | [system] | Mining | [notes] |
| Saldynium | [location] | [system] | Mining | [notes] |

## Key Mining Interdiction Locations

Based on research, these locations have high mining traffic for Wikelo items:
1. [Location 1] - [what's mined here]
2. [Location 2] - [what's mined here]
