<objective>
Research and document source locations for mission rewards, combat loot, and equipment Wikelo items.

Purpose: Compile where mission currencies (MG Scrip, Council Scrip), combat loot (Vanduul items), and equipment (drives, comp-boards) can be obtained. These items come from specific mission givers and combat zones.

Output: `.planning/phases/02-item-source-research/02-03-RESEARCH.md` with structured item→source mappings.

Use WebFetch to research mission currencies on starcitizen.tools:
- Search for "MG Scrip" and identify which missions/mission givers award it
- Search for "Council Scrip" and identify source missions
- Document mission giver locations
- Note mission types that award each currency
