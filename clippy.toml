# Clippy Configuration for Code Quality

# These rules enforce code quality standards across the project.
# Run with: cargo clippy

# Complexity limits
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 15

# Warn on functions that are too long (lines of code)
# Note: Clippy doesn't have a direct "too many lines" lint,
# but we can use other metrics as proxies
